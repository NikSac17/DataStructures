# I  have started this challenge on 20th June 2024, to upskill my DSA skills. I already revised almost all DSA Concepts in past 3 months. So level of #100dayscodechallenge of DSA Problems will be high enough.
I am IIT Hyderabad passout of 2021 batch in "Materials Science". I started coding in 4th year when placement season started, with only basic experience in C++. That time I was not able to master my skills. Though I was able to switch to @Adobe in May 2022. Currently I am working as Software Engineer 2. My goal is to master DSA and System Design. I am also intersted in Machine Learning.
Few Resources which I will we following-
